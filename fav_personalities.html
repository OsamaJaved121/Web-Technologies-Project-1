                Bill Gates
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Bill Gates turned his fortune from software firm Microsoft into a diversified fortune including
                investments zero-carbon energy.
                In May 2021, Bill and Melinda each announced on Twitter they were ending their marriage after 27 years.
                They still co-chair the charitable Gates Foundation.
                Gates, who cofounded Microsoft with Paul Allen (d. 2018) in 1975, has transferred at least $5.7 billion
                worth of shares in public companies to Melinda.
                As of March 2020, when Gates stepped down from the Microsoft board, he owned about 1% of the software
                and computing company's shares.
                He has invested in dozens of companies including Canadian National Railway and AutoNation, and is one of
                the largest owners of farmland in the U.S.
                To date, Gates has donated an estimated $35.8 billion worth of Microsoft stock to the Gates Foundation.

                Elon Musk

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth, through electric car maker Tesla --
                and in space, via rocket producer SpaceX.
                He owns 21% of Tesla but has pledged more than half his stake as collateral for loans; Forbes has
                discounted his stake to take the loans into account.
                Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion on April 25, 2022, after he disclosed
                a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover.
                SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, is valued at $100 billion after a funding round in December 2021.
                He grew up in South Africa, then immigrated to Canada at age 17. He landed in the U.S. as a transfer
                student to the University of Pennsylvania.

                Imran Khan Niazi
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Few would dispute that Imran was the finest cricketer Pakistan has produced, or the biggest heartthrob.
                Suave, erudite and monstrously talented, he gave cricket in the subcontinent real sex appeal in the
                1970s and 1980s. As such he and TV completed the popularisation of the game in his country which Hanif
                Mohammad and the radio had begun. Thousands, if not millions, who had never dreamt of bowling fast on
                heartless baked mud suddenly wanted to emulate Imran and his lithe bounding run, his leap and his
                reverse-swinging yorker. He also made himself into an allrounder worth a place for his batting alone,
                and captained Pakistan as well as anyone, rounding off his career with the 1992 World Cup. He played
                hardly any domestic cricket in Pakistan: instead he just flew in for home series from Worcestershire or
                Sussex, or rather from the more fashionable London salons. His averages (37 with the bat, 22 with the
                ball) put him at the top of the quartet of allrounders (Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee and Kapil Dev being
                the others) who dominated Test cricket in the 1980s. And whereas Botham declined steadily, Imran just
                got better and better: in his last 10 years of international cricket he played 51 Tests, averaging a
                sensational 50 with the bat and 19 with the ball. He gave no quarter during some memorable battles with
                West Indies - Pakistan drew three series with them at a time when everybody else was being bounced out
                of sight - and he led Pakistan to their first series victory in England in 1987, taking 10 for 77 with
                an imperious display in the decisive victory at Headingley. After retirement he remained a high-profile
                figure, with his marriage - and subsequent split with - the socialite Jemima Goldsmith and a move into
                the labyrinthine world of Pakistan politics.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Jeff Bezos founded e-commerce giant Amazon in 1994 out of his garage in Seattle. He stepped down as CEO
                to become executive chairman in July 2021.
                Bezos sold $8.8 billion worth of his Amazon stock in 2021 and also gave some shares away; he now owns a
                bit less than 10% of the company.
                Amazon faced criticism from U.S. senators and the general public for its treatment of warehouse workers
                during the coronavirus pandemic.
                He and his wife MacKenzie divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage and he transferred a quarter of
                his then-16% Amazon stake to her.
                Bezos owns The Washington Post and Blue Origin, an aerospace company developing rockets; he briefly flew
                to space in one in July 2021.

                Robert Downey Jr.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor and producer. His career has been
                characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and
                legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named
                by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was
                listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.

                At the age of 5, he made his acting debut in his father's film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked
                with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less Than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey
                portrayed the title character in the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award
                for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment
                Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He
                was fired from the show in the wake of drug charges in 2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug
                treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.

                Initially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the insurance bond
                for the 2003 film The Singing Detective.[4] He went on to star in the black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
                (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008); for the latter he was
                nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Downey gained global recognition for starring
                as Tony Stark / Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man
                (2008). He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him
                his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).

                Steve Jobs
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Apple cofounder Steve Jobs finally succumbed to cancer at the age of 56 on October 5th, leaving behind a
                legacy that changed the computer, music, film and wireless industries. His once written-off tech company
                in August briefly topped ExxonMobil as the most valuable U.S. corporation. In that month he resigned as
                CEO. The Reed College dropout founded Apple in his garage. Jobs created the Macintosh in 1976 and was
                fired 9 years later after a power struggle with Chief Exec John Sculley. He returned to Apple in 1996.
                At the time of his death most of his wealth still came from Disney, due to Disney's purchase of Pixar in
                2006; as the largest individual shareholder, he owned about $4.47 billion of Disney stock.

                Tom Cruise
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Tom Cruise (born July 3, 1962, Syracuse, New York, U.S.), is an American actor who emerged in the 1980s
                as one of Hollywood’s most popular leading men, known for his clean-cut
                good looks and versatility.

                Cruise, who took up acting in high school, made his film debut in Endless Love (1981). He had supporting
                roles in such movies as Taps (1981) and The Outsiders (1983) before starring as a high-school senior who
                turns his parents’ home into a brothel in Risky Business (1983). The movie was a major success, earning
                Cruise widespread recognition. His star status was cemented with Top Gun (1986), the highest-grossing
                film of that year, in which he played a navy jet pilot. In 1986 Cruise appeared opposite Paul Newman in
                The Color of Money, which was directed by Martin Scorsese, and two years later starred as an autistic
                man’s selfish brother in Rain Man. For his portrayal of a Vietnam War veteran turned activist in Born on
                the Fourth of July (1989), Cruise received his first Academy Award nomination.
