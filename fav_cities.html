                Dubai
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Dubai, also spelled Dubayy, city and capital of the emirate of Dubai, one of the wealthiest of the seven
                emirates that constitute the federation of the United Arab Emirates, which was created in 1971 following
                independence from Great Britain. There are several theories about the origin of the name Dubai. One
                associates it with the daba—a type of locust that infests the area—while another holds that it refers to
                a market that existed near the city. In recent years Dubai has been compared to Singapore and Hong Kong
                and is often regarded as the Middle East’s premier entrepôt. Area 13.5 square miles (35 square km). Pop.
                (2017 est.) 2,919,178.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Dubai is a city of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside sun-seeking
                tourism. Because of its large expatriate population, it feels like a Middle Eastern melting pot, and the
                atmosphere is generally tolerant. Religious affiliations are not a prominent aspect of city life. Islam
                is the majority religion, but churches and Hindu temples coexist with Dubai’s mosques.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The western area of Dubai benefits from small stretches of sandy beaches, which have helped to catalyze
                the city’s tourism industry. Dubai’s rulers have sought to increase the city’s limited seafronts, and,
                in the absence of natural offshore islands, developers were encouraged to construct giant man-made
                islands off the coast of the city. The most famous of these is Palm Jumeirah, which has the shape of a
                palm tree. Others include the “World” islands, a cluster of small islands positioned to resemble a world
                map when viewed from above.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Dubai’s population has grown steadily over the past two centuries, from just a few thousand local
                inhabitants to well over two million. Most of the early population increases were due to merchants from
                neighbouring countries choosing to relocate to Dubai’s business-friendly environment. In the later 20th
                century the city’s construction boom led to a huge increase in the number of South Asian labourers and
                an influx of skilled expatriates from all over the world who play an important role in Dubai’s
                multi-sector economy. Expatriates in the city vastly outnumber native Emiratis. With the exception of
                the labourers, who are housed in work camps beyond the city limits, expatriates of various nationalities
                are spread across Dubai. Although Arabic is the official language, English is, in practice, the lingua
                franca.

            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The city’s site was chosen by a commission in 1959 after Karachi was found unsuitable as the capital.
                Construction began in 1961 with an effort to blend traditional Islamic architecture with modern patterns
                and requirements. Such world-renowned names in town planning and architecture as Konstantínos Doxiádes,
                Edward Durell Stone, and Gio Ponti have been associated with the city’s development. It is a compact
                city, lying at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The second phase of construction ended with
                completion of the Secretariat, Pakistan House,
                President’s House, National Assembly Building, Grand National Mosque, and housing for government staff.
                The University of Islamabad was established in 1965 and the People’s Open University in 1974. The war
                with India in 1971 slowed construction temporarily.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The urban area is divided into eight zones: administrative, diplomatic, residential, institutional,
                industrial, and commercial areas, a greenbelt, and a national park. It includes an Olympic village and
                gardens and dairy, poultry, and vegetable farms, as well as such institutions as the Atomic Research
                Institute and the National Health Centre. The name Islamabad was chosen to reflect the country’s
                ideology.

                The planned capital area of 350 square miles is an expanse of natural terraces and
                meadows surrounding the city. A further 1,400 square miles of hinterland, known as the
                Specified Areas, is subject to planning control, with the Margala Hills, 3,000 to 5,000 feet high, in
                the north and northeast. The southern portion is an undulating plain. It is
                drained by the Kurang River, on which the Rawal Dam forms a lake holding about 50,000 acre-feet
                of water. Pop. city, 1,009,832; capital area, 2,001,579.

                Istanbul
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, is the largest city in Turkey, serving as the country's
                economic, cultural and historic hub. The city straddles the Bosporus strait, lying in both Europe and
                Asia, and has a population of over 15 million residents, comprising 19% of the population of Turkey.
                Istanbul is the most populous European city, and the world's 15th-largest city.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The city was founded as Byzantium in the 7th century BCE by Greek settlers from Megara.
                In 330 CE, the Roman emperor Constantine the Great made it his imperial capital, renaming it first as
                New Rome and then as Constantinople after himself. The city
                grew in size and influence, eventually becoming a beacon of the Silk Road and one of the most important
                cities in history.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The city served as an imperial capital for almost 1600 years: during the Roman/Byzantine,
                Latin, late Byzantine, and Ottoman empires. The city played a
                key role in the advancement of Christianity during Roman/Byzantine times, hosting four of the first
                seven ecumenical councils before its transformation to an Islamic stronghold following the Fall of
                Constantinople in 1453 CE—especially after becoming the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1517.

                Over 13.4 million foreign visitors came to Istanbul in 2018, eight years after it was named a European
                Capital of Culture, making it the world's eighth most visited city. Istanbul is home to several
                UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and hosts the headquarters of numerous Turkish companies, accounting for
                more than thirty percent of the country's economy.

                London
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the oldest of the world’s great cities—its
                history spanning nearly two millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest
                metropolis, it is also the country’s economic, transportation, and cultural centre.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                London is situated in southeastern England, lying astride the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km)
                upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. In satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen to sit
                compactly in a Green Belt of open land, with its principal ring highway (the M25 motorway) threaded
                around it at a radius of about 20 miles (30 km) from the city centre. The growth of the built-up area
                was halted by strict town planning controls in the mid-1950s. Its physical limits more or less
                correspond to the administrative and statistical boundaries separating the metropolitan county of
                Greater London from the “home counties” of Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire (in clockwise order) to the south
                of the river and Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, and Essex to the north. The historic counties of Kent,
                Hertfordshire, and Essex extend in area beyond the current administrative counties with the same names
                to include substantial parts of the metropolitan county of Greater London, which was formed in 1965.
                Most of Greater London south of the Thames belongs to the historic county of Surrey, while most of
                Greater London north of the Thames belongs historically to the county of Middlesex. Area Greater London,
                607 square miles (1,572 square km). Pop. (2001) Greater London, 7,172,091; (2011 prelim.) Greater
                London, 8,173,941.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The population of London already exceeded one million by 1800. A century later it reached 6.5 million.
                The city’s physical expansion was not constrained either by military defenses (a highly influential
                factor on continental Europe) or by the intervention of state power (so evident in the town planning of
                Paris, Vienna, Rome, and other capitals of continental Europe). Although much of the land around London
                was owned by the aristocracy, the church, and other institutions with feudal roots, its development was
                the work of unfettered capitalism driven by the housing demands of the rising middle class. Free-ranging
                building speculation engulfed villages and small towns over an ever-widening radius with each
                improvement in transport technology and purchasing power. The solidly built-up area of London measured
                some 5 miles (8 km) from east to west in 1750, 15 miles (24 km) in 1850, and 30 miles (50 km) in 1950.

            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Munich, German München, city, capital of Bavaria Land (state), southern Germany. It is Bavaria’s largest
                city and the third largest city in Germany (after Berlin and Hamburg). Munich, by far the largest city
                in southern Germany, lies about 30 miles (50 km) north of the edge of the Alps and along the Isar River,
                which flows through the middle of the city. Pop. (2011) 1,348,335; (2015 est.) 1,450,381.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Munich, or München (“Home of the Monks”), traces its origins to the Benedictine monastery at Tegernsee,
                which was probably founded in 750 CE. In 1157 Henry the Lion, duke of Bavaria, granted the monks the
                right to establish a market where the road from Salzburg met the Isar River. A bridge was built across
                the Isar the following year, and the marketplace was fortified.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                In 1255 Munich became the home of the Wittelsbach family, which had succeeded to the duchy of Bavaria in
                1180. For more than 700 years the Wittelsbachs would be closely connected with the town’s destiny. In
                the early 14th century the first of the Wittelsbach line of Holy Roman emperors, Louis IV (Louis the
                Bavarian), expanded the town to the size at which it remained up to the end of the 18th century. Under
                the Bavarian elector Maximilian I (1597–1651), a powerful and effective ruler, Munich increased in
                wealth and size and prospered until the Thirty Years’ War. It was occupied by the Swedes under Gustav II
                Adolf (Gustavus Adolphus) in 1632, and in 1634 a plague epidemic resulted in the death of about
                one-third of its population.

                The third Wittelsbach who left his mark on the community was Louis I, king
                of Bavaria from 1825 to 1848. Louis planned and created modern Munich, and his architects established
                the city’s characteristic appearance in the public buildings they designed. The 19th century was
                Munich’s greatest period of growth and development. Protestants became citizens for the first time in
                what had been until then a purely Roman Catholic town. The city’s population of 100,000 in 1854 grew to
                500,000 by 1900. Munich’s cultural importance in Europe was enhanced when Louis II, by his championing
                of the composer Richard Wagner, revived its fame as a city of music and the stage.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                In the past Munich suffered economically because of its distance from seaports and from the coal mines
                of the Ruhr region. But this situation improved when fuels other than coal came into general use. Munich
                shifted from heavy to light industry, to the manufacture, for example, of precision instruments, optical
                and electrical appliances, and aerospace and other high-technology products, as well as to the
                production of food, cosmetics, and clothing. The city has several of the largest breweries in Germany
                and is famous for its beer and its annual Oktoberfest celebration. Munich is a major tourist destination
                and a convention centre. Book publishing and printing and television production are also important. The
                city is a centre of the banking and financial industry, and it has one of the largest wholesale markets
                in Europe for fruit, vegetables, and animal produce.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Toronto, city, capital of the province of Ontario, southeastern Canada. It is the most populous city in
                Canada, a multicultural city, and the country’s financial and commercial centre. Its location on the
                northwestern shore of Lake Ontario, which forms part of the border between Canada and the United States,
                and its access to Atlantic shipping via the St. Lawrence Seaway and to major U.S. industrial centres via
                the Great Lakes have enabled Toronto to become an important international trading centre. Moreover, the
                city is positioned on the edge of some of the best farmland in Canada, with a climate favourable to
                growing a wide range of crops, thereby making Toronto a transportation, distribution, and manufacturing
                centre. Most importantly, its central location, along with a host of political policies favouring
                international trade, places this city with the greatest economic ties to, and influence from, the United
                States. Since the second half of the 20th century the city has grown phenomenally, from a rather sedate
                provincial town—“Toronto the Good”—to a lively, thriving, cosmopolitan metropolitan area. Area 244
                square miles (632 square km); metro. area, 2,280 square miles (5,905 square km). Pop. (2011) 2,615,060;
                metro. area, 5,583,064; (2016) 2,731,571; metro. area, 5,928,040.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The melting of ice from the past glacial age altered the Toronto region’s landscape profoundly.
                Approximately 11,000 years ago a body of water much larger (about 130 feet [40 metres] higher) than the
                present-day Lake Ontario was in existence there—a glacial lake referred to as Lake Iroquois. With the
                opening up of the St. Lawrence River, the lake waters receded, dropping in excess of 300 feet (90
                metres) below the present level. Over time, the water levels rose to the present condition, leaving a
                marshy shoreline but a fine natural harbour. The site of the city is almost uniformly flat, although 3
                to 4 miles (5 to 6 km) inland there is a fairly sharp rise of some 40 feet (12 metres)—the shoreline
                elevation of the former glacial lake.

                Toronto has a continental climate that is modified considerably by the proximity of the Great Lakes.
                Average temperature for January is in the low to mid-20s F (about –4.2 °C), but the wind chill factor
                can decrease this temperature considerably. In summer, the average July temperature is in the low 70s F
                (about 22.2 °C); however, it is not unusual to have summer days where the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32
                °C) and the humidity is 100 percent. The prevailing westerly winds and the Great Lakes also influence
                precipitation, which is relatively even year-round, amounting to about 33 inches (834 mm) annually. In
                winter, though, this precipitation is in the form of snow and totals in excess of 4 feet (131 cm).
                Latitude plays a role in Toronto’s relatively mild climate (as well as that of the farming region of
                southern Ontario); at 43°40′ N (with much of the farmland to the south of this latitude), Toronto is
                located only slightly north of California’s northern boundary (42° N). However, this location can
                subject the city to hurricanes—such as Hurricane Hazel in 1954, which caused approximately one billion
                Canadian dollars (in today’s terms) in damage and took 81 lives.

                A major increase in the population of Toronto (nearly fourfold expansion, from 1.3 million in 1951 to
                over 5 million by 2006) and national economic growth influenced the city skyline, which is dominated by
                the CN Tower (a communications and observation spire 1,815 feet [553 metres] high) as well as by the
                First Canadian Place (Bank of Montreal), Scotia Plaza, Canada Trust Tower, Manulife Centre, Commerce
                Court, Toronto-Dominion Centre, and Bay Adelaide Centre, each of which is more than 50 stories high.
                Other prominent buildings include City Hall (1965), Eaton Centre (a large indoor shopping complex), the
                gilded Royal Bank Plaza, the Toronto Reference Library, the Ontario Science Centre, the Royal Ontario
                Museum, with its crystal-shaped facade, and Roy Thomson Hall, noted for its excellent acoustics. The
                city also features an extensive system of underground tunnels and concourses lined with shops,
                restaurants, and theatres. Through the construction of new housing and mixed-use projects, together with
                the restoration and rehabilitation of heritage buildings, an extraordinary vitality has been brought to
                the urban core.
